# Document Scanner with OpenCV

This project was created to learn OpenCV in C++

It is divided in two parts: [Learning](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/Course) and [Practicing](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/DocumentScanner/DocumentScanner)


## Learning

The learning section is pretty straightforward, the [Course](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/Course) repository has lots of functions to manipulate images and webcam, divided into 8 parts

## Practicing

The practicing section has the [Document Scanner Project](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/DocumentScanner/DocumentScanner), wich takes a document, crops the image and applies a transformation as if you were seeing it from above.
