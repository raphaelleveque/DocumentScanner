# Document Scanner with OpenCV
This project was created to learn OpenCV in C++

It is divided in two parts: [Learning](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/Course) and [Practicing](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/DocumentScanner)


## Learning
The learning section is pretty straightforward, the [Course](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/Course) repository has lots of functions to manipulate images and webcam, divided into 8 parts


## Practicing
The practicing section has the [Document Scanner Project](https://github.com/raphaelleveque/DocumentScanner/tree/main/DocumentScanner).
Using a C++ library, OpenCV, I created a Document Scanner that crops an image of a document and applies an image transformation as if the document was seen from above. In order to do that, I used image processing fundamentals, such as: image enhancement, gray scale transformation techniques, image sharpening, etc


## How the Document Scanner Works
First, we need to add a path so the program can read an image from the computer. This was my original image: <br/>

After that, the image will be preprocessed and there will be a Canny Edge Detector image to make it easier to crop later. <br/>

The third step is to get all contours points from the document, and in order to do that, I've implemented a logic to calculate the document's area between four points. <br/>

But that wasn't enough because the points' order wasn't good, I needed a different order. <br/>

After that, I just needed to crop the image so I can have a great 2D image from the Document. <br/>
